Given certain balance sheet and cash flow metrics, can we reasonably predict whether or not a company is in the manufacturing industry?

### Overview
Data was gathered directly for financial statements submitted to the SEC. The model considered assets; liabilites & stockholder's equity; net income; and cash flows from operating, financing, and investing activitie. The model uses a random forest classifier to make its predictions. In it's current state, the model is inconclusive. The model will be imporved with additional features and modeling techniques.
